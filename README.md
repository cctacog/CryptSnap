The new way to learn encryption!

## Motivation

Before I enrolled myself into a computer organization course
in college i had no idea what encryption was, let alone how useful it could prove to me in my life of computers. So after a small introductory lab, I begun to develop my skills through simple character logic gates, transforming into this encryption calculator!

It has taken many falied features and successful debugging days to get to this point. However the experience was worth it! 
This calculator consists of the following logic gates:
#AND#
#OR#
#NAND#
#NOR#
#XOR#
#XNOR#

I also look forward to developing this program into something even grander.
