The new way to learn encryption!

## Motivation

Before I enrolled myself into a computer organization course
in college i had no idea that encryption was, let alone how useful it could prove to me in my life of computers. So after a small introductory lab, I begun to grow my skill under simple character encryption and decryption, transforming into this encryption calculator!

It has taken many falied features and successful debugging days to get to this point. However the experience was worth it! 

I also look forward to developing this program into something even grander.
